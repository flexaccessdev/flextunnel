//! Advisory single-instance file lock, shared by the server and agent binaries.
//!
//! Uses std's native advisory file locking ([`std::fs::File::try_lock`], stable
//! since Rust 1.89) — no external crate. The lock is held for the process
//! lifetime via the open [`File`] and released automatically on exit or crash
//! (the OS drops the advisory lock when the fd closes), so a stale lock file
//! never wedges a restart.
//!
//! This module owns only the mechanics; each binary chooses the *scope* by
//! passing the lock path. The server uses a per-user path (one server per user).
//! (The agent's one-per-machine guarantee instead uses a loopback-UDP singleton —
//! see [`crate::udp_lock`] — so it needs no root-writable lock path.)
//!
//! # Alternative mechanisms (if the file lock ever becomes inconvenient)
//!
//! A file lock was chosen because it is std-only, portable, and — crucially —
//! auto-released when the fd closes on exit/crash, so it never leaves stale state
//! that wedges a restart (a leftover lock *file* is harmless; the lock is the fd,
//! not the file's existence). Its only wart is filesystem path/permission friction.
//! If that friction ever outweighs the portability, these are the cleaner
//! OS-native singleton primitives.
//! They are all also auto-released on process death, which is the property that
//! disqualifies PID files and POSIX/SysV semaphores (both persist and go stale):
//!
//! | OS          | Cleanest native choice                                    |
//! |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
//! | Linux       | abstract-namespace Unix socket (`\0flextunnel-agent`) —   |
//! |             | no filesystem entry, no stale socket file, machine-wide.  |
//! | macOS / BSD | loopback UDP port (`127.0.0.1:N`); UDP dodges TCP         |
//! |             | `TIME_WAIT`. Or, for a launchd-managed daemon, rely on    |
//! |             | launchd's own single-instance-per-job guarantee and skip  |
//! |             | the lock entirely. (No abstract UDS on macOS; a Mach       |
//! |             | bootstrap port is the true analog but needs Mach FFI.)    |
//! | Windows     | named mutex (`Global\flextunnel-agent`) or loopback UDP.  |
//!
//! A single portable option across all three is **loopback UDP on a fixed high
//! port**: no filesystem at all, machine-wide by nature, auto-released. Its only
//! risk is an unrelated app squatting the port (a false "already running"), which
//! is negligible under this project's "catch accidental misconfiguration" trust
//! model. The per-OS split above is only worth it if that risk is unacceptable.

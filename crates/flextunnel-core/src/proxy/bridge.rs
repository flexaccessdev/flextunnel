//! Outbound bridge: a persistent connection from this server to **another
//! flextunnel server**, used to forward tunnel streams whose target matches the
//! bridge's rules (split-tunnel across servers). The bridging server dials out
//! on its own server endpoint, so the TLS identity it presents is its
//! persistent server id — exactly what the target server's
//! `allowed_bridge_servers` allowlist matches, alongside the `ftb` token.
//!
//! The connect/auth/heartbeat machinery mirrors [`super::agent`], with one
//! deliberate difference in reconnect policy: a bridge retries **forever** (no
//! fail-fast first connect, no attempt cap). The peer server may simply not be
//! up yet, and a server daemon must not exit — or stop serving its other
//! routes — because a peer is down. While the upstream is down, matching
//! streams fail with host-unreachable (see `route_to_bridge` in
//! [`super::server`]).

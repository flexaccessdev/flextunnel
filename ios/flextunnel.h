/*
 * flextunnel.h — C interface to libflextunnel.xcframework for the iOS app.
 *
 * Build the static library slices with ./build-ios.sh (produces
 * dist/ios/libflextunnel.xcframework alongside a copy of this header).
 *
 * Unlike a VPN, there is no Network Extension and no utun fd. Browser sessions
 * may run a SOCKS5 listener for WKWebView; forwarding-only sessions omit it and
 * use server-direct local forward listeners owned by the Rust core.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *   1. flextunnel_init_logging()                          (once, optional)
 *   2. flextunnel_start(configJson, buf, len) -> handle   (or NULL on error)
 *        On success `buf` holds {"socks_port": N|null};
 *        configure the WKWebView proxy with NWEndpoint host 127.0.0.1, port N.
 *        On error `buf` holds the error message. At most ONE instance may run
 *        at a time; a second start while one is live returns NULL.
 *   3. flextunnel_health(handle) -> 1 running / 0 ended / -1 null  (poll)
 *   -  flextunnel_conn_path(handle, buf, len)             (on-demand path readout)
 *   -  flextunnel_set_background(handle, 1|0)             (scene-phase changes)
 *   -  flextunnel_set_network_available(handle, 1|0)      (NWPathMonitor updates)
 *   -  flextunnel_close_listeners(handle)                 (just before suspension)
 *   4. flextunnel_stop(handle)                            (on teardown)
 *
 * Pass a numeric "socks_port" to bind the browser's loopback SOCKS5 listener
 * (0 requests an OS-assigned port; a nonzero port is a preference — if it is
 * in use the start binds an OS-assigned port instead of failing, so always
 * read the bound port from the result JSON). Pass null or omit it for a
 * forwarding-only session with no SOCKS5 listener.
 *
 * All functions are NULL-safe and never unwind into Swift.

 * not need to enforce the split itself. Before the first successful handshake,
 * connected is false and the lists are empty. The set becomes available shortly
 * after start once the handshake completes, so poll it. host_aliases ([alias,
 * target] pairs) is informational, for display only — the server resolves the
 * aliases itself. dns_forwards is the
 * server's conditional DNS-forwarding table, also informational: each entry is
 * {"suffix","servers"} — names under suffix resolve via servers instead of the
 * server's system resolver. Empty when none are configured. bridges is the
 * server's outbound bridge-route table (targets it forwards to another
 * flextunnel server), also informational: each entry is
 * {"name","endpoint_id","domains","cidrs"}; the bridged rules are already part
 * of the routed set. Empty when none are configured.

/*
 * flextunnel.h — C interface to libflextunnel.xcframework for the iOS app.
 *
 * Build the static library slices with ./build-ios.sh (produces
 * dist/ios/libflextunnel.xcframework alongside a copy of this header).
 *
 * Unlike a VPN, there is no Network Extension and no utun fd. Browser sessions
 * may run a SOCKS5 listener for WKWebView; forwarding-only sessions omit it and
 * use server-direct local forward listeners owned by the Rust core.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *   1. flextunnel_init_logging()                          (once, optional)
 *   2. flextunnel_start(configJson, buf, len) -> handle   (or NULL on error)
 *        On success `buf` holds {"socks_port": N|null};
 *        configure the WKWebView proxy with NWEndpoint host 127.0.0.1, port N.
 *        On error `buf` holds the error message. At most ONE instance may run
 *        at a time; a second start while one is live returns NULL.
 *   3. flextunnel_health(handle) -> 1 running / 0 ended / -1 null  (poll)
 *   -  flextunnel_conn_path(handle, buf, len)             (on-demand path readout)
 *   4. flextunnel_stop(handle)                            (on teardown)
 *
 * Pass a numeric "socks_port" to bind the browser's loopback SOCKS5 listener
 * (0 requests an OS-assigned port). Pass null or omit it for a forwarding-only
 * session with no SOCKS5 listener.
 *
 * All functions are NULL-safe and never unwind into Swift.

 * — the domains/CIDRs routed through the tunnel (off-list targets connect
 * directly). Before the first successful handshake, connected is false and the
 * lists are empty. The set becomes available shortly after start once the
 * handshake completes, so poll it. host_aliases ([alias, target] pairs) and
 * agent_aliases are informational, for display only — the server resolves both
 * itself. Each agent_aliases entry is {"name","status"} where status is
 * "connected", "disconnected", or "unknown"; it rides the heartbeat control
 * stream (refreshed every ~10s) and reads "unknown" before the first update,
 * while the tunnel is down, or when the view has gone stale. dns_forwards is the
 * server's conditional DNS-forwarding table, also informational: each entry is
 * {"suffix","servers"} — names under suffix resolve via servers instead of the
 * server's system resolver. Empty when none are configured. bridges is the
 * server's outbound bridge-route table (targets it forwards to another
 * flextunnel server), also informational: each entry is
 * {"name","endpoint_id","domains","cidrs"}; the bridged rules are already part
 * of the routed set. Empty when none are configured.
 *
 * Returns 1 on success (full JSON written), 0 if out_buf was too small (the JSON
 * is truncated; retry larger), and -1 for a NULL handle or if the route snapshot
 * could not be read. out_buf is always NUL-terminated when usable (non-NULL,
 * out_len > 0): the error returns write an empty string.

# Architecture

flextunnel is a **SOCKS5/HTTP-proxy-over-QUIC split tunnel**: local proxy
listeners on the **client** parse each request, match it against the
server-pushed tunnel set, and either direct-connect off-list targets from the
client device or tunnel on-list targets over reliable QUIC bi-streams to the
**server**. Tunneled targets are resolved and connected *from the server's own
network*. Transport, NAT traversal, relay fallback, and TLS 1.3 encryption come
from [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/). Neither side needs a TUN device or
admin/root — it is ordinary userspace sockets end to end.

```

All streams from one client multiplex over a **single** QUIC `Connection`. The
control stream authenticates once; each subsequent data bi-stream carries one
tunneled proxied TCP connection. Direct off-list connections never touch the
server.

## Module map (`src/`)

| `proxy/dial.rs` | `Target` → TCP dial + `connect_and_pipe` (the shared server/agent exit-point body) |

**Bridges** split-tunnel *across servers*: a `[bridges.<name>]` entry on server A
forwards targets matching its domain/CIDR rules verbatim over a persistent
connection to server B, which re-enforces its own routed set, applies its own
aliases/agent routes/DNS forwards, and dials from its network. A dials out on its
own server endpoint, so the TLS-authenticated id it presents is its persistent
server id — which B must list in `allowed_bridge_servers` in addition to
validating the `ftb` token (both gates required; empty allowlist = inbound
bridging disabled). Bridged-in streams are served like client streams but are
never re-bridged (single hop, so mutual bridges cannot loop). Bridge rules must
be reachable through A's routed set (validated at startup, like `dns_forwards`
coverage).

The reverse-routing agent ships as a **separate binary crate** (`flextunnel-agent`,
Linux/macOS/Windows, not in the module map above): it reads the OS-native machine
id (via the `machine-uid` crate — `/etc/machine-id`, `IOPlatformUUID`, or
`MachineGuid`), derives a one-way, versioned **network id** from it
(`machine_id::network_machine_id` → `ftm1…`) so the raw id never leaves the host,
holds a machine-wide single-instance lock, and drives `proxy::agent::ProxyAgent`
over an ephemeral `create_client_endpoint`. `flextunnel-agent machine-id` prints
the raw id and its derived network id locally.

The agent's one-per-machine guarantee is a **loopback-UDP singleton**
(`udp_lock::UdpInstanceLock`): it exclusively binds a fixed `127.0.0.1` UDP port,
which is machine-wide by nature and needs no filesystem and no root, working
identically on Linux/macOS/Windows. This contrasts with the per-user server,
whose single-instance guarantee is a file lock under `~/.config/flextunnel/`.

## Connection lifecycle

### 1. ALPN
The ALPN value is the fixed constant `flextunnel/1` (`transport::ALPN`). It is a
protocol-negotiation label sent **unencrypted** in the TLS/QUIC handshake, not a
secret: both peers must offer the same ALPN or negotiation fails. Access control
is enforced by the auth handshake below, not by the ALPN.

### 2. Auth handshake (control stream)
The protocol version is `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 8`. On the first bi-stream the
connecting peer sends
`Hello { version, auth_token, client_instance_nonce, duplicate_server_observed, role, machine_id }`
and the server replies
`HelloResponse { version, accepted, reject_reason, server_instance_nonce, routed_*, host_aliases, agent_aliases, connected_agents, dns_forwards, bridges }`,
both length-prefixed JSON via `signaling::write_message` / `read_message` (4-byte
big-endian length + payload, capped at `MAX_HANDSHAKE_SIZE` = 64 KiB). The server
checks the token against the role's accepted set (`ftc` client, `fta` agent, or
`ftb` bridge tokens). Clients send `role = Client` with no machine id; agents send
`role = Agent` plus their derived network id (`ftm1…`, the hashed machine id — the
raw id never goes on the wire); bridging servers send `role = Bridge` with no
machine id (their persistent iroh id is TLS-authenticated and checked against the
`allowed_bridge_servers` allowlist). On rejection it closes the
connection gracefully (with a short drain) carrying the reason. `Hello`'s
`Debug` impl redacts `auth_token`.

The `*_instance_nonce` fields are random per-process ids (distinct from the iroh
node id) that drive duplicate-id detection (see below); `duplicate_server_observed`
is a client advisory. Unlike earlier versions the handshake bi-stream is **not
closed** after the exchange — it stays open as the control stream carrying
heartbeats (§6).

The server bounds accepting/reading the client `Hello` with a 10s timeout, and
the client bounds waiting for the server `HelloResponse` with the same timeout
(`HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` in `client.rs` / `server.rs`), because QUIC keep-alive
otherwise prevents the idle timeout from firing on a peer that connects but
never speaks.

### 3. Per-request data streams
For each on-list local request that needs the tunnel, the client opens a new
bi-stream and writes a compact request header, then reads a one-byte reply, then
pipes raw bytes:

```
Request (client→server):  [ver=1][atyp][addr][port:u16 BE]
    atyp 0x01 IPv4 → 4 bytes   0x03 DOMAIN → [len:u8][host]   0x04 IPv6 → 16 bytes
Reply   (server→client):  [ver=1][rep]      then raw bytes both ways
```

`rep` values are deliberately equal to RFC 1928 SOCKS5 reply codes
(`REP_SUCCESS=0x00`, `REP_HOST_UNREACHABLE=0x04`, …), so the client forwards the
server's reply byte straight into its SOCKS5 reply to the local app with no
translation table. The header is parsed with `read_exact` (ATYP fixes the
length; domains ≤ 255 bytes).

### 4. Server-side resolve + connect
The server reads the requested `Target`, enforces the routed-set whitelist on
that requested target, handles reserved `flextunnel.internal` status routes and
agent routes, then (bounded by `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` = 10s in `proxy/dial.rs`) either
`TcpStream::connect`s a literal address or, for a domain, calls
`tokio::net::lookup_host` and connects to the first address that accepts.
**DNS happens on the server** for tunneled domain targets, which is what lets
clients reach names/IPs that only resolve or route from the server's network.
Connect failures map to SOCKS5 reply codes via `signaling::map_io_err`.

### 5. Byte piping
Both ends join the iroh `(SendStream, RecvStream)` halves with
`tokio::io::join` and run `tokio::io::copy_bidirectional` against the `TcpStream`.
This propagates half-close correctly (EOF on one side → `shutdown`, which quinn
maps to a stream FIN). Per-stream errors stay per-stream — the shared QUIC
`Connection` is never closed for a single failed proxied connection.

### 6. Heartbeat & liveness (control stream)
After the handshake the control bi-stream stays open. The client sends a
`ControlMsg::Heartbeat { seq }` every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (10s) and the server
replies `HeartbeatAck { seq }`, framed with the same length-prefixed helpers
(capped at `MAX_CONTROL_MSG_SIZE` = 16 KiB). This is an app-level liveness signal *on top
of* QUIC keep-alive: it catches an *application-level* stall — a peer still
answering QUIC keep-alive at the transport level but no longer sending
heartbeats — within `LIVENESS_WINDOW` (33s: three heartbeat intervals plus 3s
grace). A fully silent peer is caught sooner by the 30s QUIC idle timeout, which
fires first. On the server,
heartbeats also refresh the per-client connection registry used for duplicate
detection (below). A missing heartbeat surfaces as a recoverable
`ConnectionLost`, so the client's normal reconnect path applies. The heartbeat
runs concurrently with the SOCKS5 stream loop via `tokio::select!` on both sides.

## Duplicate-id detection

A guard rail against *accidental misconfiguration* (not an adversary defense —
see the security model). Both roles carry a random per-process **instance nonce**
that is distinct from the iroh node id, exchanged in the handshake.

**Duplicate client (server-side).** Client identity is ephemeral (a fresh key per
process), so two *different* client processes never share a node id; a node id
seen on two concurrently-live connections is a rare bug. The server keeps a
registry keyed by client node id, and within it by connection, refreshed by the
heartbeat. Two live connections for one node id with **different** instance nonces
are a confirmed duplicate (a benign same-process reconnect reuses the *same*
nonce and is ignored). On confirmation the server tears down the offending
connections and records the node id in the persisted blocklist (`blocklist.rs`);
a blocklisted node id is rejected up-front. Because ephemeral ids never recur,
the persisted client entry is largely an audit record.

**Duplicate agent (server-side).** An agent's iroh id is ephemeral and irrelevant
to its identity — it is identified by its stable **network id** (`ftm1…`), a
one-way, versioned hash of its OS-native machine id (`/etc/machine-id` on Linux,
`IOPlatformUUID` on macOS, `MachineGuid` on Windows) that the agent derives so the
raw id never reaches the server. The `flextunnel-agent` binary's loopback-UDP
singleton already guarantees one agent *process* per machine. The server tracks
one active connection per network id and uses the agent's instance nonce to
distinguish a benign same-process reconnect (same nonce, supersedes the stale
connection) from a genuine duplicate (different nonce, e.g. a cloned VM image
whose machine id was never regenerated). On that collision the server tears both
down and records the network id in the blocklist (`blocked_agents`). Because the
network id is stable (unlike an ephemeral client id), that block keeps rejecting
the id until the operator fixes the duplicate and clears the entry.

**Duplicate server (self-block).** Server identity is persistent, so two servers
sharing one secret key is a plausible misconfiguration — but only observable when
both are reachable by the *same client over a shared discovery/relay path*
(same-id servers on isolated networks that no client can reach both of are not a
conflict). Each server emits a stable `server_instance_nonce`; a restart yields a
fresh nonce that never reappears, whereas a client bouncing between two concurrent
same-id servers sees a previously-seen nonce **reappear** after a different one.
On that reappearance the client latches an advisory (`duplicate_server_observed`)
into its next `Hello` — a non-privileged observation, not a command. The server,
on receiving it from any active client, records its **own** `EndpointId` in the
blocklist and shuts down; on the next start it refuses to run while its id is
listed. Detection is best-effort and delayed (it needs client churn to observe
both instances); prompt, robust detection would require a signaling server. See
[`duplicate-detection-roadmap.md`](./duplicate-detection-roadmap.md).

The blocklist is a JSON file at the fixed path
`~/.config/flextunnel/blocklist.json` — deliberately **not** configurable, since
relocating this security guard rail would let it be bypassed. It is written
atomically (temp + rename) and loaded at startup.

## Concurrency model

- **Server:** one tokio task per accepted iroh connection (`handle_connection`,
  capped at `MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS`), and within it one task per accepted
  data bi-stream (`handle_socks_stream`). No shared mutable state on the data
  path; the accepted-token set is read-only.
- **Client:** one task per accepted local TCP connection (`handle_local_conn`),
  from the SOCKS5 listener and optional HTTP listener. All tunneled requests
  share the single `Connection` clone; off-list requests direct-connect locally.
  The local listeners and the QUIC connection liveness are raced with
  `tokio::select!` so a dropped connection breaks into the reconnect path.

## Reconnect policy (client)

Implemented in `ProxyClient::run` / `handle_failure`:

- The **first** connection must succeed; if it fails (even a transient error),
  the client exits — a bad node id, wrong relay, or down server is not worth
  retrying blindly.
- After at least one success, transient drops (`ConnectionLost` / `Network` /
  `Signaling` — see `ProxyError::is_recoverable`) are retried with **exponential
  backoff + jitter** (1s → 60s), indefinitely, unless `--max-reconnect-attempts`
  caps it or `--no-auto-reconnect` disables it.
- Permanent errors (`AuthenticationFailed` / `Config`) never retry.
- The local proxy listeners stay bound across reconnects. Off-list targets keep
  connecting directly; on-list requests fail immediately with a network-unreachable
  reply until the tunnel recovers.

On every exit path both `run_server` and `run_client` call
`endpoint.close().await` before the `Endpoint` drops; skipping it makes iroh tear
down its relay tasks ungracefully (a `JoinSet` panic that is fatal under the
release profile's `panic = "abort"`).

## Security model & trust boundaries

**Purpose & threat model.** flextunnel exists to let a set of **trusted clients**
reach resources on the **server's** side of the network — names and addresses that
only resolve or route from where the server sits. Both ends of the deployment are
operated by the same trusted party: whoever runs the server also decides which
clients get tokens. flextunnel is *not* a multi-tenant service and does not defend
the server against the clients it admits — a client with a valid token is, by
design, allowed to reach whatever the server's network can reach. The threats it
does address are **on-path attackers** (defeated by QUIC/TLS 1.3 encryption and
per-client tokens) and **accidental misconfiguration** — the duplicate-id
detection (see "Duplicate-id detection" above) catches, e.g., two clients or two
servers started with the same identity, blocking the conflicted id and refusing a
self-blocked server's restart. These are guard rails for operators, not adversary
defenses.

- **Bearer tokens:** client (`ftc`), agent (`fta`), and bridge (`ftb`) auth
  tokens are separate CRC16-checksummed Base64URL credential pools checked in the
  handshake. The QUIC ALPN (`flextunnel/1`) is a fixed protocol identifier, not
  a credential. All payload is encrypted by QUIC/TLS 1.3.
- **The server is the exit point.** Anyone with valid tokens can reach whatever
  the server's network can reach (including its `localhost`). Treat token
  distribution accordingly; scope server network access if needed.
- **The local SOCKS5/HTTP proxy listeners are unauthenticated** and bind to
  loopback by default — access control lives at the QUIC layer, not in the local
  proxy front-ends. Binding them off-loopback exposes an open proxy on the LAN;
  don't, unless you add auth.
- iroh's relay/discovery operators can see connection *metadata* (which endpoints
  talk), never the encrypted payload.

## Relation to ezvpn

flextunnel reuses ezvpn's iroh transport, auth-token scheme, and
secret-key identity, but replaces the IP-over-QUIC-datagrams + TUN data path
(which needs root) with SOCKS5/HTTP proxy front-ends over reliable QUIC streams
(which don't). See the project `README.md` for the user-facing comparison.

## Roadmap

HTTP proxy support is implemented on the client side; the wire protocol and
server remain front-end-agnostic. See
[`http-proxy-roadmap.md`](./http-proxy-roadmap.md).

Reverse routing is loopback-only in v1. A follow-up will let one agent (machine
id) expose several hostnames each mapped to a chosen host/IP on the agent's own
network (an `agent_ip` target, default `127.0.0.1`); the server already rewrites
the routed target before opening the agent stream, so this is a server-side
config + rewrite change with no agent-side protocol change.

Future work on duplicate-id detection — non-ephemeral client ids and their
pitfalls, the signaling-server path for prompt server-dup detection, and
client-side dup acknowledgement/flagging — is in
[`duplicate-detection-roadmap.md`](./duplicate-detection-roadmap.md).

# Architecture

flextunnel is a **SOCKS5/HTTP-proxy-over-QUIC split tunnel**: local proxy
listeners on the **client** parse each request, match it against the
server-pushed tunnel set, and either direct-connect off-list targets from the
client device or tunnel on-list targets over reliable QUIC bi-streams to the
**server**. Tunneled targets are resolved and connected *from the server's own
network*. Transport, NAT traversal, relay fallback, and TLS 1.3 encryption come
from [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/). Neither side needs a TUN device or
admin/root — it is ordinary userspace sockets end to end.

```

All streams from one client multiplex over a **single** QUIC `Connection`. The
control stream authenticates once; each subsequent data bi-stream carries one
tunneled proxied TCP connection. Direct off-list connections never touch the
server.

**Bridges** split-tunnel *across servers*: a `[bridges.<name>]` entry on server A
forwards targets matching its domain/CIDR rules verbatim over a persistent
connection to server B, which re-enforces its own routed set, applies its own
aliases/DNS forwards, and dials from its network. A dials out on its
own server endpoint with the bridge ALPN, so the TLS-authenticated id it
presents is its persistent server id — which B must list in
`allowed_bridge_servers`, the sole bridge credential, enforced natively at the
TLS handshake by B's endpoint hook (empty allowlist = inbound bridging
disabled). Bridged-in streams are served like client streams but are
never re-bridged (single hop, so mutual bridges cannot loop). Bridge rules must
be reachable through A's routed set (validated at startup, like `dns_forwards`
coverage).

## Connection lifecycle

### 1. ALPN
Clients connect with the fixed constant `flextunnel/1` (`transport::ALPN`);
bridging servers connect with `flextunnel-bridge/1` (`transport::BRIDGE_ALPN`);
quick-mode clients connect with `flextunnel-quick/1` (`transport::QUICK_ALPN`).
The ALPN is a protocol-negotiation label sent **unencrypted** in the TLS/QUIC
handshake, not a secret: it carries the peer's *role*, never a credential.
Keypair-client access control is the auth handshake below; bridge and quick-client
access control is an endpoint-id allowlist (`allowed_bridge_servers`, or the
single client id entered on a quick server), enforced **natively at the TLS
handshake** by an iroh `EndpointHooks::after_handshake` hook
(`transport::endpoint::AllowlistHook` over `EndpointAllowlists`) — a
non-allowlisted peer's connection is closed with the reason before it ever
reaches the accept loop, and the id needs no further proof because iroh's
handshake authenticates it. An empty set disables its ALPN entirely (a normal
server rejects every quick dial; a no-bridging server rejects every bridge).

### 2. Auth handshake (control stream)
The protocol version is `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 13`. On the first bi-stream a
client sends
`Hello { version, auth?, client_instance_nonce, duplicate_server_observed }`
where `auth` is `ClientAuthPayload { public_key, endpoint_id, signature }`
(a bridge sends the minimal `BridgeHello { version }` — its authentication
already happened at the TLS handshake) and the server replies
`HelloResponse { version, accepted, reject_reason, server_instance_nonce, routed_*, host_aliases, dns_forwards, bridges }`,
both length-prefixed JSON via `signaling::write_message` / `read_message` (4-byte
big-endian length + payload, capped at `MAX_HANDSHAKE_SIZE` = 64 KiB). On the
client ALPN `auth` is required: the server checks that the claimed
`endpoint_id` equals the connection's TLS-authenticated `remote_id()`, that the
ed25519 `signature` (over a domain-separated hash of that id) verifies under
`public_key`, and that `public_key` is on the server's authorized-keys file —
binding the credential to this connection so a captured `Hello` cannot be
replayed from another endpoint. On the quick ALPN `auth` is absent — the
allowlist hook already authenticated the endpoint id, and everything after the
handshake (routed set, duplicate detection, heartbeats, data streams) is
identical for both. On rejection the server closes the connection gracefully
(with a short drain) carrying the reason. Nothing in the payload is secret, so
`Hello` derives `Debug` plainly.

The `*_instance_nonce` fields are random per-process ids (distinct from the iroh
node id) that drive duplicate-id detection (see below); `duplicate_server_observed`
is a client advisory. Unlike earlier versions the handshake bi-stream is **not
closed** after the exchange — it stays open as the control stream carrying
heartbeats (§6).

The server bounds accepting/reading the client `Hello` with a 10s timeout, and
the client bounds waiting for the server `HelloResponse` with the same timeout
(`HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` in `client.rs` / `server.rs`), because QUIC keep-alive
otherwise prevents the idle timeout from firing on a peer that connects but
never speaks.

### 3. Per-request data streams
For each on-list local request that needs the tunnel, the client opens a new
bi-stream and writes a compact request header, then reads a one-byte reply, then
pipes raw bytes:

```
Request (client→server):  [ver=1][atyp][addr][port:u16 BE]
    atyp 0x01 IPv4 → 4 bytes   0x03 DOMAIN → [len:u8][host]   0x04 IPv6 → 16 bytes
Reply   (server→client):  [ver=1][rep]      then raw bytes both ways
```

`rep` values are deliberately equal to RFC 1928 SOCKS5 reply codes
(`REP_SUCCESS=0x00`, `REP_HOST_UNREACHABLE=0x04`, …), so the client forwards the
server's reply byte straight into its SOCKS5 reply to the local app with no
translation table. The header is parsed with `read_exact` (ATYP fixes the
length; domains ≤ 255 bytes).

### 4. Server-side resolve + connect
The server reads the requested `Target`, enforces the routed-set whitelist on
that requested target, handles reserved `flextunnel.internal` status routes,
then (bounded by `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` = 10s in `proxy/dial.rs`) either
`TcpStream::connect`s a literal address or, for a domain, calls
`tokio::net::lookup_host` and connects to the first address that accepts.
**DNS happens on the server** for tunneled domain targets, which is what lets
clients reach names/IPs that only resolve or route from the server's network.
Connect failures map to SOCKS5 reply codes via `signaling::map_io_err`.

### 5. Byte piping
Both ends join the iroh `(SendStream, RecvStream)` halves with
`tokio::io::join` and run `tokio::io::copy_bidirectional` against the `TcpStream`.
This propagates half-close correctly (EOF on one side → `shutdown`, which quinn
maps to a stream FIN). Per-stream errors stay per-stream — the shared QUIC
`Connection` is never closed for a single failed proxied connection.

### 6. Heartbeat & liveness (control stream)
After the handshake the control bi-stream stays open. The client sends a
`ControlMsg::Heartbeat { seq }` every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (10s) and the server
replies `HeartbeatAck { seq }`, framed with the same length-prefixed helpers
(capped at `MAX_CONTROL_MSG_SIZE` = 16 KiB). This is an app-level liveness signal *on top
of* QUIC keep-alive: it catches an *application-level* stall — a peer still
answering QUIC keep-alive at the transport level but no longer sending
heartbeats — within `LIVENESS_WINDOW` (33s: three heartbeat intervals plus 3s
grace). A fully silent peer is caught sooner by the 30s QUIC idle timeout, which
fires first. On the server,
heartbeats also refresh the per-client connection registry used for duplicate
detection (below). A missing heartbeat surfaces as a recoverable
`ConnectionLost`, so the client's normal reconnect path applies. The heartbeat
runs concurrently with the SOCKS5 stream loop via `tokio::select!` on both sides.

## Duplicate-id detection

A guard rail against *accidental misconfiguration* (not an adversary defense —
see the security model). Both roles carry a random per-process **instance nonce**
that is distinct from the iroh node id, exchanged in the handshake.

**Duplicate client (server-side).** Client identity is ephemeral (a fresh key per
process), so two *different* client processes never share a node id; a node id
seen on two concurrently-live connections is a rare bug. The server keeps a
registry keyed by client node id, and within it by connection, refreshed by the
heartbeat. Two live connections for one node id with **different** instance nonces
are a confirmed duplicate (a benign same-process reconnect reuses the *same*
nonce and is ignored). On confirmation the server tears down the offending
connections and records the node id in the persisted blocklist (`blocklist.rs`);
a blocklisted node id is rejected up-front. Because ephemeral ids never recur,
the persisted client entry is largely an audit record.

**Duplicate server (self-block).** Server identity is persistent, so two servers
sharing one secret key is a plausible misconfiguration — but only observable when
both are reachable by the *same client over a shared discovery/relay path*
(same-id servers on isolated networks that no client can reach both of are not a
conflict). Each server emits a stable `server_instance_nonce`; a restart yields a
fresh nonce that never reappears, whereas a client bouncing between two concurrent
same-id servers sees a previously-seen nonce **reappear** after a different one.
On that reappearance the client latches an advisory (`duplicate_server_observed`)
into its next `Hello` — a non-privileged observation, not a command. The server,
on receiving it from any active client, records its **own** `EndpointId` in the
blocklist and shuts down; on the next start it refuses to run while its id is
listed. Detection is best-effort and delayed (it needs client churn to observe
both instances); prompt, robust detection would require a signaling server. See
[`duplicate-detection-roadmap.md`](./duplicate-detection-roadmap.md).

The blocklist is a JSON file at the fixed path
`~/.config/flextunnel/blocklist.json` — deliberately **not** configurable, since
relocating this security guard rail would let it be bypassed. It is written
atomically (temp + rename) and loaded at startup.

## Concurrency model

- **Server:** one tokio task per accepted iroh connection (`handle_connection`,
  capped at `MAX_CONCURRENT_CONNECTIONS`), and within it one task per accepted
  data bi-stream (`handle_socks_stream`). No shared mutable state on the data
  path; the authorized-keys set is read-only (loaded at startup).
- **Client:** one task per accepted local TCP connection (`handle_local_conn`),
  from the SOCKS5 listener and optional HTTP listener. All tunneled requests
  share the single `Connection` clone; off-list requests direct-connect locally.
  The local listeners and the QUIC connection liveness are raced with
  `tokio::select!` so a dropped connection breaks into the reconnect path.

## Reconnect policy (client)

Implemented in `ProxyClient::run` / `handle_failure`:

- Every recoverable failure (`ConnectionLost` / `Network` / `Signaling` — see
  `ProxyError::is_recoverable`) is retried with **exponential backoff +
  jitter** (1s doubling to `RECONNECT_BACKOFF_MAX`, 60s), indefinitely,
  unless `--max-reconnect-attempts` caps it or `--no-auto-reconnect` disables
  it. The first attempt is no different from any later one: a server that is
  down or not up yet is the ordinary case (boot order, maintenance), not an
  error to exit on. A bad node id or relay URL is a `Config` error and still
  fails on the first attempt.
- Permanent errors (`AuthenticationFailed` / `Config`) never retry — the same
  credential and config would fail the same way every time.
- A long outage costs one bounded connect (`CONNECT_TIMEOUT`) per attempt on
  the endpoint the client already holds, once a minute at the cap.
  Two events cut a backoff step short with a fresh series: the device
  reporting its network path back (`set_network_available`) and the embedding
  app coming to the foreground (`set_background(false)`), so a user who is
  looking never waits out a step sized for a long outage.
- An outage's **third** consecutive failure escalates to a **full endpoint
  rebuild** (`ClientEndpoint::rebuild`), repeated at most every
  `REBUILD_ENDPOINT_MIN_INTERVAL` (30 min) for as long as the outage lasts; the
  other retries nudge `Endpoint::network_change()` (rebinds dead UDP sockets)
  instead. The rebuild swaps in a freshly bound endpoint — new sockets, new
  relay connections, fresh discovery — and closes the wedged one in the
  background. This is the in-process equivalent of restarting the client, for
  wedges a rebind can't fix (a relay link lost to a ping timeout and never
  re-established, stale cached paths for the server). It is the expensive step
  and it repairs the *endpoint*; a rebuilt endpoint that still cannot connect
  has ruled that out, which is why it is rate-limited rather than repeated on
  every third failure. The rebuild skips the startup per-relay probe and
  tolerates the online-wait failing, so a partial outage never blocks
  recovery. A successful connection resets the budget.
- The loop publishes its progress (`ProxyClient::reconnect_status`: failed
  attempts, last error, next attempt due) for status displays; the CLI panel
  shows it on the phase line.
- The local proxy listeners stay bound across reconnects. Off-list targets keep
  connecting directly; on-list requests are held for the reconnect — up to 45s
  (`TUNNEL_RECOVERY_HOLD`), deploy-style connection holding — and only then fail
  with a network-unreachable reply.

## Relay failover (server, custom relays)

Implemented once for every FlexAccess program in the shared
[flexaccess-iroh](https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flexaccess-iroh) crate
(`relay_failover::fail_over_home_relay`), run here by the CLI's `run_server`
alongside `ProxyServer::run`; the design is documented once in
[iroh-common-architecture/relay-failover.md](https://github.com/flexaccessdev/iroh-common-architecture/blob/main/relay-failover.md).
A custom-relay server is dialable from off the LAN only while it is
**registered on its home relay** (n0 discovery is off; clients dial by relay
hint, and a relay forwards Initials only to endpoints connected to it). iroh
re-homes on its own when a relay is really down, but not when the relay keeps
answering net-report probes while relay connections to it fail (the shape seen
on v1.0.3 behind Cloudflare tunnels, unchanged in v1.1.0): net_report keeps
preferring it, the relay connection never re-establishes, and the server is
registered nowhere until the process restarts, while LAN clients that find it
over mDNS keep working and hide the outage (the mac desktop reconnects, the iOS
app times out).

The failover watches `Endpoint::home_relay_status()`. After 60 s
(`RELAY_OUTAGE_FAILOVER`) without a connected home relay it takes the wedged
relay **out of the endpoint's relay map**; the forced net report can only
prefer a relay still in the map, so the endpoint homes on another configured
relay **in place**: same server id, same allowlists, same sockets, same direct
paths, same established connections and bridge tasks. Nothing is rebuilt. The
removed relay is probed every 90 s (`RELAY_RESTORE_INTERVAL`) and put back once
it is connectable again. Relays that failed the **startup** probe are handled
the same way: the endpoint is bound without them
(`CreatedEndpoint::relays_left_out`) and the failover restores them, so a
server or client that starts during such an outage still comes online on the
relay that works.

A reconnect at any point resets the outage clock. Non-home relays are
connected on demand and dropped after a minute idle, which is normal and never
counts as an outage. With the default relays the failover is pending forever:
reachability there rests on n0 publishing/resolution, not on one relay
registration. A custom relay set must therefore hold at least two distinct
relays, which `RelayConfig` enforces at startup.

Until flexaccess-iroh v0.0.7 this was a watchdog that nudged
`Endpoint::network_change()` (a no-op on a stable host) and then rebuilt the
endpoint, dropping every connection; both are gone. The client's own endpoint
rebuild (above) is unrelated and stays: it answers a wedged *client* endpoint
after a network change, and it is flextunnel's code, not the crate's.

On every exit path both `run_server` and `run_client` call
`endpoint.close().await` before the `Endpoint` drops; skipping it makes iroh tear
down its relay tasks ungracefully (a `JoinSet` panic that is fatal under the
release profile's `panic = "abort"`).

## Security model & trust boundaries

**Purpose & threat model.** flextunnel exists to let a set of **trusted clients**
reach resources on the **server's** side of the network — names and addresses that
only resolve or route from where the server sits. Both ends of the deployment are
operated by the same trusted party: whoever runs the server also decides which
clients' keys get authorized. flextunnel is *not* a multi-tenant service and does not defend
the server against the clients it admits — a client with an authorized key is, by
design, allowed to reach whatever the server's network can reach. The threats it
does address are **on-path attackers** (defeated by QUIC/TLS 1.3 encryption and
per-client keypairs) and **accidental misconfiguration** — the duplicate-id
detection (see "Duplicate-id detection" above) catches, e.g., two clients or two
servers started with the same identity, blocking the conflicted id and refusing a
self-blocked server's restart. These are guard rails for operators, not adversary
defenses.

- **Credentials:** client keypairs are ed25519 in the shared
  [flexaccess-keys](https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flexaccess-keys) format —
  the public key travels as `ed25519-pub:` + base64url, the secret as
  `ed25519-sec:` + base64url — verified in the handshake via a signature bound
  to the connection's endpoint id under a flextunnel-specific
  domain-separation context. That context is what rejects a signature produced
  for another FlexAccess app — cross-app isolation holds because each app signs
  under its own distinct context, not because the shared library enforces
  anything about how applications use the keys. Bridges and quick-mode clients
  carry no keypair: their credential is their TLS-authenticated endpoint id,
  checked natively against the matching allowlist — `allowed_bridge_servers`,
  or the single client id entered on a quick server (the `authorized_keys`
  model). The QUIC ALPNs (`flextunnel/1`, `flextunnel-bridge/1`,
  `flextunnel-quick/1`) are fixed protocol/role identifiers, not credentials.
  All payload is encrypted by QUIC/TLS 1.3.
- **The server is the exit point.** Anyone with an authorized key can reach whatever
  the server's network can reach (including its `localhost`). Authorize keys
  accordingly; scope server network access if needed.
- **The local SOCKS5/HTTP proxy listeners are unauthenticated** and bind to
  loopback by default — access control lives at the QUIC layer, not in the local
  proxy front-ends. Binding them off-loopback exposes an open proxy on the LAN;
  don't, unless you add auth.
- iroh's relay/discovery operators can see connection *metadata* (which endpoints
  talk), never the encrypted payload.

## Relation to ezvpn

flextunnel reuses ezvpn's iroh transport and
secret-key identity, but replaces the IP-over-QUIC-datagrams + TUN data path
(which needs root) with SOCKS5/HTTP proxy front-ends over reliable QUIC streams
(which don't). See the project `README.md` for the user-facing comparison.

## Roadmap

HTTP proxy support is implemented on the client side; the wire protocol and
server remain front-end-agnostic. See
[`http-proxy-roadmap.md`](./http-proxy-roadmap.md).

Future work on duplicate-id detection — non-ephemeral client ids and their
pitfalls, the signaling-server path for prompt server-dup detection, and
client-side dup acknowledgement/flagging — is in
[`duplicate-detection-roadmap.md`](./duplicate-detection-roadmap.md).

# flextunnel

A SOCKS5/HTTP-proxy, and port-forward-over-QUIC split tunnel. The **client**
runs optional local SOCKS5 and HTTP proxy listeners, plus optional port
forwards that send a local port straight to one server-side address. Each
proxy request is matched
against the server-pushed tunnel set: routed targets are tunneled as reliable
QUIC bi-streams to the **server**, which performs **DNS resolution and the
outbound TCP connection from its own network**, then pipes bytes back; off-list
targets are connected directly from the client device. A forwarded port does no
matching on the client: everything it accepts goes to the server, which
enforces its routed set there.

This lets you reach hosts that are only reachable from the server side — a
private network, the server's own `localhost`, or names that only resolve via
the server's DNS — without a VPN. Because it uses ordinary userspace sockets
(no TUN device), **neither the client nor the server needs admin/root**.

Transport, NAT traversal, relay fallback, and TLS 1.3 encryption are provided by
[iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/): the client dials the server by its
`EndpointId`, so the server needs no public inbound port or port forwarding.

```

## Scope

- **SOCKS5 `CONNECT` only.** No UDP `ASSOCIATE`, no `BIND`. The optional HTTP
  proxy supports HTTP `CONNECT` plus absolute-URI plain-HTTP forwarding.
- The local SOCKS5 and HTTP proxy listeners are **unauthenticated**, and each is
  disabled unless explicitly configured. Any local user or process that can reach
  them can use the tunnel, so they **bind `127.0.0.1` only** (you configure just
  the port, like the desktop client) and flextunnel assumes a **trusted,
  single-user host**. The client keypair authenticates the client *process* to
  the server; it does **not** authenticate local callers of the proxy
  front-ends, and is no substitute for OS-level access control on a shared
  machine.

## Security model

flextunnel lets a set of **trusted clients** reach resources on the **server's**
side of the network. Both ends are run by the same trusted party: whoever runs
the server decides which client keys it authorizes. It is **not** a multi-tenant
service and does not defend the server against the clients it admits — a client
with an authorized key can, by design, reach whatever the server's network can
reach (including the server's own `localhost`). Authorize keys accordingly, and
scope the server's network access if that reach is too broad. The threats it does
address are on-path attackers (encryption + per-client keypairs) and accidental
misconfiguration (e.g. duplicate-id detection catching two clients or servers
started with the same identity — an operator guard rail, not an adversary
defense).

A per-client ed25519 keypair gates every connection:

- **Client keypair** — each client generates a keypair in the shared
  [flexaccess-keys](https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flexaccess-keys) format
  (`flexaccess-keys generate-auth-key`); the server keeps the public keys in an
  ssh-style authorized-keys file. In the handshake the client sends its public
  key, its (ephemeral) iroh endpoint id, and a signature over that id; the
  server accepts only if the claimed id matches the connection's
  TLS-authenticated id, the signature verifies, and the key is authorized —
  the secret never leaves the client, and a captured handshake cannot be
  replayed from another endpoint.

(The keyless exceptions are server-to-server bridges and `--quick` sessions,
whose credential is the peer's TLS-authenticated **EndpointId**, checked
natively against an allowlist at the handshake — the `authorized_keys` model.)

The QUIC ALPN is a fixed protocol identifier (`flextunnel/1`), not a secret: it
ensures both peers speak the flextunnel protocol but provides no access control
on its own.

All payload is end-to-end encrypted by QUIC/TLS 1.3.

## Install

Prebuilt release assets are published on the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flextunnel/releases) page.
Stable releases include `flextunnel` for Linux
amd64/arm64, macOS arm64, and Windows amd64, plus the iOS xcframework asset.
Automated prereleases currently include Linux amd64/arm64, macOS arm64, and the
iOS xcframework, but skip Windows. The install scripts download the latest
binary and verify its SHA-256 checksum. On Linux/macOS this installs to a
per-user location (`~/.local/bin`, no root required). On Windows this installs
system-wide to `C:\Program Files\flextunnel` and updates the machine PATH,
which **requires an elevated (Administrator) PowerShell session** — running
the installed binary afterward does not.

**`flextunnel` (server / client) — Linux / macOS:**

```sh
curl -sSL https://flexaccessdev.github.io/flextunnel/install.sh | bash
```

**`flextunnel` (server / client) — Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://flexaccessdev.github.io/flextunnel/install.ps1 | iex
```

Options: append `-s -- --prerelease` (bash) for the latest prerelease, a release
tag to pin a version, or `--download-only` / `-DownloadOnly` to fetch the binary
without installing. `-PreRelease` is also accepted by the Windows installer when
the selected prerelease includes a Windows asset. A container image is also
published to `ghcr.io/flexaccessdev/flextunnel`.

### Desktop app (tray GUI, client mode)

Stable releases also include the desktop client
(`flextunnel-desktop-macos-arm64.dmg` and
`flextunnel-desktop-windows-amd64.msi`). The installers are **unsigned** — if
you'd rather not apply the workarounds below, build it yourself instead:

```sh
cargo build --release -p flextunnel-desktop
# binary: target/release/flextunnel-desktop — locally built binaries are not
# quarantined, so no workaround is needed
```

That produces the bare executable, **not** a `.app` bundle — so on macOS it has
no `Info.plist` and will show a Dock icon instead of running as a pure menu-bar
app. For the proper bundle, build it the way CI does with `cargo-packager`
(macOS only; `app` gives `flextunnel.app`, `dmg` gives the drag-to-Applications
disk image):

```sh
cargo install cargo-packager   # or: cargo binstall cargo-packager
cargo packager --release -p flextunnel-desktop --formats app
# bundle: target/release/flextunnel.app  (locally built → not quarantined,
# so no Gatekeeper workaround needed; use --formats dmg for a .dmg instead)
```

Otherwise:

**macOS:** because the app is not notarized, Gatekeeper quarantines the
download and shows *"flextunnel" is damaged and can't be opened*.

The cleanest fix is to avoid the quarantine flag in the first place: browsers
set `com.apple.quarantine` on downloads, but command-line tools like `curl` and
`wget` do not. Download the disk image from the terminal instead:

```sh
# Replace vX.Y.Z with the release tag from the Releases page.
curl -fL -o flextunnel-desktop.dmg \
  https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flextunnel/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/flextunnel-desktop-macos-arm64.dmg
```

Then in Finder: double-click the `.dmg` to open it, drag `flextunnel.app` onto
the **Applications** shortcut in the window (choose **Replace** if an older copy
is already there), then eject the mounted image.

> **macOS zsh note:** the shell snippets in this README include `#` comment
> lines. zsh (the macOS default shell) treats `#` as a comment on an
> interactive prompt only after `setopt interactivecomments`; without it,
> pasting a `#` line reports `command not found`. Run `setopt interactivecomments`
> once per session, or just omit the comment lines when pasting.

If you already downloaded the `.dmg` via a browser, the quarantine flag
propagates to the app you copy out of it; remove it after installing (into
`/Applications`) instead:

```sh
xattr -cr /Applications/flextunnel.app
```

Alternatively, right-click the app and choose **Open** the first time.

**Windows:** SmartScreen's *"Windows protected your PC"* warning is triggered by
the Mark of the Web (the `Zone.Identifier` stream), which — like macOS
quarantine — is set by browsers but not by command-line tools. Avoid it the same
way: download with `curl.exe` (bundled in Windows 10+) or PowerShell instead of a
browser. Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the release tag from the Releases page:

```powershell
curl.exe -fL -o flextunnel-desktop.msi `
  https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flextunnel/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/flextunnel-desktop-windows-amd64.msi
# or: Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile flextunnel-desktop.msi `
#   https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flextunnel/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/flextunnel-desktop-windows-amd64.msi
```

If you already downloaded via a browser, strip the mark instead:
`Unblock-File .\flextunnel-desktop-windows-amd64.msi` (or right-click →
Properties → **Unblock**). Otherwise click **More info → Run anyway**.

## Build from source

```sh
cargo build --release
# binary: target/release/flextunnel
```

Requires a recent Rust toolchain (edition 2024). A bare `cargo build --release`
uses the workspace's default members and builds the CLI, but not
the iOS static library. To cross-build the CLI for Linux amd64 + arm64 via
Docker, use `./build-linux.sh`.

## Quick start

### 1. Generate credentials (once)

```sh
flextunnel generate-iroh-key -o server.key   # prints the server's EndpointId
flextunnel show-iroh-id --secret-file server.key   # re-print the EndpointId
```

Client authentication keys are managed by the standalone
[`flexaccess-keys`](https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flexaccess-keys) CLI;
install it with its one-line installer
(`curl -sSL https://flexaccessdev.github.io/flexaccess-keys/install.sh | bash`,
Windows: `irm https://flexaccessdev.github.io/flexaccess-keys/install.ps1 | iex`):

```sh
# On each client machine: generate that client's keypair, then derive its
# public authorized-key entry. Send only the public entry to the server admin.
flexaccess-keys generate-auth-key "alice laptop" -o client.key
flexaccess-keys show-auth-key --private-key-file client.key
```

Without `-o`, the generate commands print the key file to stdout instead.
Keep `server.key` and each `client.key` private (written `0600` on Unix; both
key files carry `# Created:` / `# Public key:` comments). Share
the server's **EndpointId** with clients, and collect each client's printed
**authorized-key entry** (`ed25519-pub:…` — not a secret) into the server's
authorized-keys file, one per line with an optional trailing comment, ssh
`authorized_keys` style:

```text
# ./authorized_keys
ed25519-pub:XXXXXXXX alice laptop
ed25519-pub:YYYYYYYY build server
```

All commands above accept `--json` for machine-readable output (QA automation).

### 2. Configure and run the server (no root needed)

The routed set is required and is configured in `server.toml`. This example is a
full tunnel; narrow it later with specific domains/CIDRs if you want split
tunneling.

```toml
secret_file = "./server.key"

# Authorized client public keys — always a file (ssh authorized_keys style).
authorized_keys_file = "./authorized_keys"

routed_domains = ["*"]
routed_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]

[host_aliases]
"server.internal" = "127.0.0.1"
```

```sh
flextunnel server start -c server.toml
```

It prints `flextunnel server Node ID: <ENDPOINT_ID>` — give that to clients.

### 3. Run the client (no root needed)

```sh
flextunnel client start \
    --server-node-id <ENDPOINT_ID> \
    --auth-key-file  client.key \
    --socks-port     1080            # SOCKS5 on 127.0.0.1:1080 (loopback only)
```

### 4. Use it

Point any SOCKS5 client at `127.0.0.1:1080`. Use `socks5h://` so routed
hostnames reach flextunnel as names and are resolved on the server side:

```sh
# With the full-tunnel routed set above, DNS + connect happen server-side.
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 https://example.com

# a server-side host alias, for example server.internal -> 127.0.0.1
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 http://server.internal:8000/

# SSH through the proxy
ssh -o ProxyCommand='nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:1080 %h %p' user@internal-host
```

#### Quick ephemeral tunnel (no setup)

For a throwaway "route everything through this box for a few minutes" session,
`--quick` skips all of the above — no key files, no config. There is
no keypair auth at all: each side enters the **other side's EndpointId**. The
client's id becomes the server's one-entry allowlist (enforced natively at the
TLS handshake, like bridge allowlisting), and dialing the server's id is itself
what authenticates the server:

```sh
# On the client host: prints this client's EndpointId (enter it on the server)
# and prompts for the server EndpointId, then shows a live control panel in
# this terminal. Needs an interactive terminal.
flextunnel client start --quick

# On the server host: prompts for the client EndpointId printed above and
# allowlists it as the only allowed client, then prints this server's
# EndpointId to enter at the client prompt. Full-tunnels all traffic; exits on
# its own if the client doesn't connect within 5 minutes. Nothing is persisted.
flextunnel server start --quick
```

Either side can start first — both block at their prompt until the other's id
is entered.

The quick server runs a full tunnel (`routed_domains = ["*"]`,
`routed_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]`); enter a SOCKS5/HTTP port at the client
prompt to open a local proxy listener. Both sides are fully ephemeral: neither
takes the single-instance lock (so a quick session can run alongside a real one,
or another quick one), and both forget everything on exit.

The quick client is **self-contained**: after the prompt it runs the same live
panel as [`client control`](#client-control) right in that terminal — but it
opens **no control socket** (nothing else can attach to it), and quitting the
panel (`q`) **disconnects** the tunnel and exits, rather than detaching. A
quick client reads no config, so it has no port forwards.

#### Server status page

From a connected client, `flextunnel.internal` is reserved by flextunnel and is
always tunneled to the server, regardless of the routed set. The browser view is
HTML; `/status.txt` is plain text and `/status.json` is structured JSON for
scripts:

```sh
# plain-text status through the default SOCKS5 listener
curl -sS -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 http://flextunnel.internal/status.txt

# JSON status through the default SOCKS5 listener
curl -sS -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 http://flextunnel.internal/status.json

# same endpoint through the optional HTTP proxy listener
curl -sS -x http://127.0.0.1:8081 http://flextunnel.internal/status.txt
curl -sS -x http://127.0.0.1:8081 http://flextunnel.internal/status.json
```

The JSON response includes `version`, `server_node_id`, `routed_domains`,
`routed_cidrs`, `host_aliases`, `dns_forwards`, `bridges`,
`inbound_bridges`, and duplicate-id blocklist counts under
`duplicate_id_blocklist`.

For more ways to use the proxy — `curl`/`git`/browser recipes, `ssh` through the
tunnel, and putting a plain local TCP port in front of it for apps that can't
speak SOCKS5 (databases, RDP, most GUIs) — see
[`docs/proxy-usage.md`](docs/proxy-usage.md).

#### HTTP proxy front-end (optional)

Add `--http-port <PORT>` to also run an HTTP proxy alongside SOCKS5 — useful
for the many tools that only speak an HTTP proxy or whose SOCKS5 support
resolves DNS client-side (`wget`, Docker pulls, npm/yarn, JVM/JDBC). It
handles HTTPS (and any TCP) via `CONNECT` tunneling and plain-HTTP via
absolute-URI forwarding; either way the hostname goes to the proxy, so DNS
still happens on the server.

```sh
flextunnel client start \
    --server-node-id <ENDPOINT_ID> \
    --auth-key-file  client.key \
    --socks-port     1080 \
    --http-port      8081

# HTTPS tunnels via CONNECT; plain HTTP is forwarded
https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8081 curl https://example.com
http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8081  curl http://example.com
```

See [`docs/http-proxy-roadmap.md`](docs/http-proxy-roadmap.md) for the gap
analysis and what it doesn't cover (raw-TCP apps still need SOCKS5 or `socat`).

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `server start` | Run the proxy server. |
| `client start` | Run the proxy client (optional SOCKS5 and HTTP proxy listeners, plus the port forwards declared in its config). |
| `client control` | Attach the read-only terminal control panel to a running client. |
| `client help` | Show the client subcommands and their help. |
| `generate-iroh-key [-o <FILE>] [--force] [--json]` | Generate the server's iroh identity key (stdout without `-o`). |
| `show-iroh-id --secret-file <FILE> [--json]` | Print the iroh id (EndpointId) for a key. |

Client auth keypairs are generated with the standalone
[`flexaccess-keys`](https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flexaccess-keys) CLI
(`generate-auth-key` / `show-auth-key`), not by `flextunnel` itself.

### `server start`

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-c, --config <FILE>` | Load options from a TOML file (CLI flags override it). |
| `--default-config` | Load `~/.config/flextunnel/server.toml`. |
| `--secret-file <FILE>` | Server identity key. |
| `--authorized-keys-file <FILE>` | File of authorized client public keys, one `ed25519-pub:…` per line (optional trailing comment, ssh `authorized_keys` style). |
| `--relay-url <URL>` | Custom relay URLs (repeatable; at least two distinct relays, since the server rides out a relay outage by moving onto another one). Configuring custom relays disables n0 internet discovery: clients reach this server via relay hints, and outbound bridges attach the same hints when dialing peer servers. mDNS local discovery stays on. |
| `--relay-auth-token <TOKEN>` | Shared bearer token sent to every custom relay's WebSocket upgrade. Only valid with `--relay-url` (rejected with the default relays). |
| `--quick` | Ephemeral one-off server: prompt for the client's EndpointId (shown by `client start --quick`) and natively allowlist it as the only allowed client — no auth keypair — then mint an in-memory identity, full-tunnel all traffic, print this server's EndpointId, and exit if the client doesn't connect within 5 minutes. Needs an interactive terminal. Takes no single-instance lock; nothing is persisted. Conflicts with `-c`/`--secret-file`/`--authorized-keys-file`. |

### `client start`

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-c, --config <FILE>` | Load options from a TOML file (CLI flags override it). Without it, `~/.config/flextunnel/client.toml` is used if present. |
| `-n, --server-node-id <ID>` | Server EndpointId. |
| `--socks-port <PORT>` | Optional SOCKS5 listener port, e.g. `1080`. Binds `127.0.0.1` only. Disabled unless set. |
| `--http-port <PORT>` | Optional HTTP proxy listener port (CONNECT + plain-HTTP forwarding). Binds `127.0.0.1` only. |
| `--auth-key <SECRET>` / `--auth-key-file <FILE>` | Client auth keypair (one required): the inline `ed25519-sec:…` secret, or the key file from `flexaccess-keys generate-auth-key`. |
| `--relay-url <URL>` | Custom relay URLs (repeatable; at least two distinct relays, the same set as the server). Configuring custom relays disables n0 internet discovery (the server is reached via relay hints); mDNS local discovery stays on. |
| `--relay-auth-token <TOKEN>` | Shared bearer token sent to every custom relay's WebSocket upgrade. Only valid with `--relay-url` (rejected with the default relays). |
| `--auto-reconnect` | Force auto-reconnect on (overrides `auto_reconnect = false` in the config). |
| `--no-auto-reconnect` | Exit on the first failed connection attempt or drop instead of retrying. |
| `--max-reconnect-attempts <N>` | Cap consecutive retries before giving up (unlimited if unset). |
| `--quick` | Self-contained ephemeral session (pairs with `server start --quick`): ignore any saved config, print this client's EndpointId (enter it at the quick server's prompt — that allowlist entry is the credential; no auth keypair), prompt for the server EndpointId, then run the live control panel in this terminal. Needs an interactive terminal. Takes no lock and opens no control socket; quitting the panel disconnects. Nothing is persisted. Conflicts with `-c`/`--auth-key(-file)`. |

`flextunnel client start` needs at least one flag — run with no arguments and it
prints help. With a flag but no `-c`, it loads `~/.config/flextunnel/client.toml`
if it exists (so `flextunnel client start --socks-port 1080` runs off the default
config). `--quick` ignores any saved config, prints this client's EndpointId
(its credential — enter it on the quick server; there is no auth keypair), and
prompts (on an interactive terminal) for the server EndpointId and optional
proxy ports, then
runs the self-contained control panel described under [`client control`](#client-control)
right in that terminal — but with no control socket exposed, and quitting the
panel disconnects instead of detaching. Nothing is saved.

Port forwards are declared in the config as `[[forwards]]` tables (see
[`client.toml.example`](client.toml.example)): each listens on
`localhost:<local_port>` and opens a server-direct stream to
`<remote_host>:<remote_port>` on the authenticated connection (the server
enforces its routed set and resolves the host). They are validated at startup
(nonzero ports, valid host, unique local ports) and all come up with the
client. There is no CLI flag and nothing can be changed live: to change the
set, edit the config and restart the client.

With neither `--socks-port` nor `--http-port` (nor the config keys) the
client runs in **port-forward-only mode**: it holds the tunnel and serves only
the control panel and the port forwards.

A client's on-disk identity — the single-instance lock and the control
socket — is keyed by the prefix of its `server_node_id` (which never changes
for a profile). So one client runs per server per user, and clients for
different servers coexist without any extra configuration. The optional `name`
key in the config ("aws", "home network") is a display-only label shown in the
control panel. (A `--quick` client is exempt: it takes neither — no lock, no
socket.)

### `client control`

```sh
flextunnel client control                # profile from ~/.config/flextunnel/client.toml
flextunnel client control -c aws.toml    # profile from a specific config
flextunnel client control -n <ENDPOINT_ID>   # or by server id directly
```

Attaches a **read-only** terminal control panel to the **running** client for
a profile, over its control socket
(`~/.config/flextunnel/client-<server id prefix>.sock`; a named pipe on
Windows). It shows live status — connection phase and uptime, server/client
node ids, connection paths (direct/relay), the server-pushed routing breakdown
(split-tunnel rules, host aliases, DNS forwards, and bridge routes), and the
**port forwards** declared in the client's config with their live state
(listening, active connections, or switched off with the bind-failure reason).

Nothing about the client can be changed from the panel: the forward set is
fixed by the config for the life of the client (edit the config and restart to
change it), and the channel carries no mutations. It runs as the same user as
the client — no elevated privilege on either end.

Detaching (`q`) never affects the tunnel; several panels can attach at once.

## Configuration files

Instead of passing everything on the command line, `server start` and
`client start` can read a TOML file:

```sh
flextunnel server start -c server.toml
flextunnel client start -c client.toml
flextunnel client start --socks-port 1080  # loads ~/.config/flextunnel/client.toml
```

Precedence is **CLI flag > config file > built-in default**, so you can keep a
file and override settings on the command line. Credential groups are replaced
as a unit: for example, if the CLI supplies either `--auth-key` or
`--auth-key-file`, the config file's `auth_key_file` is ignored. Unknown
or misspelled keys are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`) rather than silently
ignored. Paths support `~` expansion.

See [`server.toml.example`](server.toml.example) and
[`client.toml.example`](client.toml.example) for the full set of keys. A minimal
client file:

```toml
server_node_id = "<server endpoint id>"
socks_port     = 1080          # SOCKS5 on 127.0.0.1:1080 (loopback only)
auth_key_file  = "~/.config/flextunnel/client.key"
```

Private keys are always file references in a config (`secret_file`,
`auth_key_file`) — there are no inline-key config keys. CLI flags still work
and override any of these (`--auth-key` exists only as a CLI flag).

Server-only routing keys include `host_aliases`,
`dns_forwards`, outbound `[bridges.<name>]`, and inbound
`allowed_bridge_servers`; these are config-file only because they describe the
server's routing policy. Bridges carry no keypair: a bridging server
authenticates by its TLS-authenticated endpoint id, which the receiving server
must list in `allowed_bridge_servers` (enforced natively at the handshake).

## Host aliases (server-side)

The server config can map hostnames to addresses on its own network, so a client
can reach the server's loopback or internal hosts by a real name. Add a
`[host_aliases]` table to `server.toml` (config-file only — there is no CLI flag):

```toml
[host_aliases]
"server.internal" = "127.0.0.1"      # the server's own loopback
"node2.internal"  = "192.168.1.50"   # another host on the server's network
```

When a requested hostname matches a key (case-insensitive), the server rewrites
it to the value — an IP or another hostname — keeping the requested port, then
resolves and connects like any other target. Only domain targets are aliased;
literal IPs pass through unchanged.

This is also the clean way around Firefox refusing to proxy literal
`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`: alias `server.internal` → `127.0.0.1` on the server and
browse to `http://server.internal:8000/`. Use `socks5h://` (or set Firefox's
`network.proxy.socks_remote_dns = true`) so the name is resolved by the server,
not locally.

## Routed-set split-tunneling

The routed set (the **tunnel set**) is a VPN-style split-tunnel "included routes"
list that decides which destinations traverse the tunnel. Targets not on it are
**not** rejected — the client falls back to a direct connection for them. It is
useful when a client must send *all* its traffic to the local SOCKS5 proxy (e.g.
an iOS WebView, whose proxy config is global) but only some hosts should actually
be tunneled. It is **required** and configured on the **server only** (config-file
only — there is no CLI flag); the client configures nothing:

```toml
# server.toml
routed_domains = ["*.example.com", "httpbin.org"]
routed_cidrs   = ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.1.5"]
```

The tunnel set is required: a server started with an empty set **refuses to
start**, and a client that receives an empty set from a (misconfigured or old)
server **aborts the handshake** rather than silently direct-connecting
everything. To route **all** traffic through the tunnel (full tunnel), use the
catch-alls:

```toml
routed_domains = ["*"]
routed_cidrs   = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]
```

The server is the single source of truth. It **pushes** the list to every client
in the handshake response, so there is no client list to keep in sync:

- **Client** — on connect it learns the server's list. It tunnels only matching
  targets and connects everything else **directly** from its own network
  (split-tunneling). The direct path is independent of the tunnel, so off-list
  targets keep connecting even while the tunnel is down; an on-list target during
  a drop/backoff is held for the client's own reconnect (up to 45s, deploy-style
  connection holding) and proceeds transparently once the link is back — only a
  reconnect that never lands within the hold gets a network-unreachable failure
  (SOCKS5 reply `0x03`; the HTTP front-end maps it to `502 Bad Gateway`).
- **Server** — it also enforces the same list independently as a **whitelist**,
  **rejecting** any tunnel request for a target not on it (SOCKS5 reply `0x02`).
  This is a defense-in-depth boundary against a misconfigured or untrusted
  client. (Note the asymmetry: the client falls back to a direct connection for
  off-list targets, whereas the server rejects them outright.)

Matching: domain entries are exact (`example.com`), wildcard (`*.example.com`,
which matches subdomains only — not the bare apex), or `*` (matches every
hostname), case-insensitive; CIDR entries match IP targets, accept a bare IP as a
single host, and a default route (`0.0.0.0/0` / `::/0`) matches every IP.
Hostnames are matched only against `routed_domains` and IPs only against
`routed_cidrs`. A numeric IP literal is always gated by `routed_cidrs` even
when a client sends it in hostname form (SOCKS5 `ATYP_DOMAIN`), so `*` never lets
a raw IP through — it can only route real hostnames.

Only the **combined** set must be non-empty — setting just one list is fine. The
two never cross: an omitted/empty list means that whole category is off-list and
always direct-connected. So `routed_domains` alone (no `routed_cidrs`)
tunnels those hostnames but direct-connects every bare-IP target, and
`routed_cidrs` alone tunnels those IPs but direct-connects every hostname.

### Roadmap

- **Client blocking mode.** Today the client **always direct-connects** every
  off-list target (split-tunneling), and this is
  the same for the desktop and iOS clients (they share the same core). A future
  client option — likely `routed_mode = "block" | "direct"` (default
  `"direct"`) — will let a client instead **refuse** an off-list connection,
  returning a SOCKS5 error to the local app rather than falling back to a direct
  connection. This is aimed mainly at the desktop client, where blocking off-list
  traffic can be preferable to letting it leak out directly; the iOS client keeps
  defaulting to direct-connect. (The server's `0x02` rejection above is a
  separate, server-side control and is unaffected.)

## Reconnect behavior

Auto-reconnect is **enabled by default** (`auto_reconnect = true`); pass
`--no-auto-reconnect` (or set `auto_reconnect = false`) to disable it, and
`--auto-reconnect` to force it on over a config that disabled it.

- A failed connection attempt — the **first one included** — or a lost
  connection is retried with **exponential backoff + jitter** (1s doubling to
  60s), indefinitely, unless `--max-reconnect-attempts` caps it or
  auto-reconnect is disabled. A server that is down, or not up yet, is the
  ordinary case, not a reason to exit: the client waits it out and connects
  when the server appears.
- A long outage is cheap to sit through: once the backoff reaches its cap the
  client makes one bounded connect attempt a minute. Repeated
  failures escalate to rebuilding the iroh endpoint from scratch after the
  third one, and then at most every 30 minutes for as long as the outage
  lasts (see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md#reconnect-policy-client)).
- A permanent error (a rejected key, a malformed config) never retries; that
  is the only kind of error the client exits on.
- The control panel shows the outage's progress: failed attempts so far, the
  last error, and when the next attempt is due.
- The local proxy listeners stay bound across reconnects. Off-list targets keep
  connecting directly; on-list requests are held for the reconnect (up to 45s)
  and only then fail with a network-unreachable reply.

A **server** with custom relays watches its own home-relay registration: if it
has no connected home relay for 60s and iroh has not re-homed it on its own,
it takes the wedged relay out of its relay map and homes on another configured
relay in place (same server id, same sockets, nothing dropped), so clients off
the LAN (the iOS app) are not stranded until someone restarts the service. The
relay is put back once it is connectable again. A custom relay set is
therefore at least two distinct relays. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md#relay-failover-server-custom-relays).

## Logging

Logging uses `env_logger`. The default is `info` with iroh/tracing quieted to
`warn`. Override with `RUST_LOG`, e.g. `RUST_LOG=flextunnel=debug`.

  ([key-format specification](https://github.com/flexaccessdev/flexaccess-keys/blob/main/docs/key-format.md)),
  and the `generate-auth-key` / `show-auth-key` CLI. flextunnel links against
  the same crate for parsing and verification and retains only its own
  domain-separated authentication transcript.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — how it works: connection
  lifecycle (fixed ALPN, auth handshake, per-stream protocol), module map,

- [`docs/systemd.md`](docs/systemd.md) — running the CLI client under systemd:
  one template-unit instance per server, why `Restart=on-failure` is the whole
  restart policy, attaching the control panel, journald logging.
- [`docs/http-proxy-roadmap.md`](docs/http-proxy-roadmap.md) — the HTTP proxy
  front-end (CONNECT tunneling + absolute-URI forwarding): motivation, design,
  and remaining hardening work.
- [`docs/proxy-usage.md`](docs/proxy-usage.md) — using the SOCKS5 and HTTP
  proxies: which listener a tool needs, native SOCKS5 clients (`curl`, `git`,
  browsers), HTTP-proxy-only tools (`wget`, Docker, JVM/JDBC), `ssh`
  through the tunnel, and `socat`/`ssh -L`/`-D` forwards for apps that speak
  neither.

## How it relates to ezvpn

flextunnel is modeled on the sibling project **ezvpn** (an IP-over-QUIC VPN),
reusing its iroh transport and secret-key identity (client access control is
flextunnel's own ed25519 keypair scheme). The difference: ezvpn creates a TUN device and ships IP packets over
unreliable QUIC datagrams (and needs root); flextunnel exposes SOCKS5/HTTP proxy
listeners and tunnels TCP over reliable QUIC streams (and needs no root).

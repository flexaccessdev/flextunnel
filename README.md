# flextunnel

A SOCKS5/HTTP-proxy-over-QUIC split tunnel. The **client** runs a local SOCKS5
listener and, optionally, an HTTP proxy listener. Each request is matched
against the server-pushed tunnel set: routed targets are tunneled as reliable
QUIC bi-streams to the **server**, which performs **DNS resolution and the
outbound TCP connection from its own network**, then pipes bytes back; off-list
targets are connected directly from the client device.

This lets you reach hosts that are only reachable from the server side — a
private network, the server's own `localhost`, or names that only resolve via
the server's DNS — without a VPN. Because it uses ordinary userspace sockets
(no TUN device), **neither the client nor the server needs admin/root**.

Transport, NAT traversal, relay fallback, and TLS 1.3 encryption are provided by
[iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/): the client dials the server by its
`EndpointId`, so the server needs no public inbound port or port forwarding.

```

```

## Scope

- **TCP `CONNECT` only.** No UDP `ASSOCIATE`, no `BIND`.
- The local SOCKS5 listener is **no-auth** and binds to loopback by default;
  access control is enforced by the QUIC layer (auth token), not by SOCKS5.

## Security model

flextunnel lets a set of **trusted clients** reach resources on the **server's**
side of the network. Both ends are run by the same trusted party: whoever runs
the server decides which clients get tokens. It is **not** a multi-tenant service
and does not defend the server against the clients it admits — a client with a
valid token can, by design, reach whatever the server's network can reach
(including the server's own `localhost`). Distribute tokens accordingly, and
scope the server's network access if that reach is too broad. The threats it does
address are on-path attackers (encryption + per-client tokens) and accidental
misconfiguration (e.g. duplicate-id detection catching two clients or servers
started with the same identity — an operator guard rail, not an adversary
defense).

A per-client auth token gates every connection:

- **Auth token** — sent in the connection handshake and checked against the
  server's accepted set. Per-client, like an API key.

The QUIC ALPN is a fixed protocol identifier (`flextunnel/1`), not a secret: it
ensures both peers speak the flextunnel protocol but provides no access control
on its own.

All payload is end-to-end encrypted by QUIC/TLS 1.3.

## Install

Prebuilt release assets are published on the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/andrewtheguy/flextunnel/releases) page.
Stable releases include `flextunnel` and `flextunnel-agent` for Linux
amd64/arm64, macOS arm64, and Windows amd64, plus the iOS xcframework asset.
Automated prereleases currently include Linux amd64/arm64, macOS arm64, and the
iOS xcframework, but skip Windows. The install scripts download the latest
binary and verify its SHA-256 checksum. On Linux/macOS this installs to a
per-user location (`~/.local/bin`, no root required). On Windows this installs
system-wide to `C:\Program Files\flextunnel` and updates the machine PATH,
which **requires an elevated (Administrator) PowerShell session** — running
the installed binary afterward does not.

**`flextunnel` (server / client) — Linux / macOS:**

```sh
curl -sSL https://andrewtheguy.github.io/flextunnel/install.sh | bash
```

**`flextunnel` (server / client) — Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://andrewtheguy.github.io/flextunnel/install.ps1 | iex
```

**`flextunnel-agent` (reverse-routing agent) — Linux / macOS:**

```sh
curl -sSL https://andrewtheguy.github.io/flextunnel/install-agent.sh | bash
```

**`flextunnel-agent` (reverse-routing agent) — Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://andrewtheguy.github.io/flextunnel/install-agent.ps1 | iex
```

Options: append `-s -- --prerelease` (bash) for the latest prerelease, a release
tag to pin a version, or `--download-only` / `-DownloadOnly` to fetch the binary
without installing. `-PreRelease` is also accepted by the Windows installer when
the selected prerelease includes a Windows asset. A container image is also
published to `ghcr.io/andrewtheguy/flextunnel`.

### Desktop app (tray GUI, client mode)

Stable releases also include the desktop client
(`flextunnel-desktop-macos-arm64.dmg` and
`flextunnel-desktop-windows-amd64.msi`). The installers are **unsigned** — if
you'd rather not apply the workarounds below, build it yourself instead:

```sh
cargo build --release -p flextunnel-desktop
# binary: target/release/flextunnel-desktop — locally built binaries are not
# quarantined, so no workaround is needed
```

That produces the bare executable, **not** a `.app` bundle — so on macOS it has
no `Info.plist` and will show a Dock icon instead of running as a pure menu-bar
app. For the proper bundle, build it the way CI does with `cargo-packager`
(macOS only; `app` gives `flextunnel.app`, `dmg` gives the drag-to-Applications
disk image):

```sh
cargo install cargo-packager   # or: cargo binstall cargo-packager
cargo packager --release -p flextunnel-desktop --formats app
# bundle: target/release/flextunnel.app  (locally built → not quarantined,
# so no Gatekeeper workaround needed; use --formats dmg for a .dmg instead)
```

Otherwise:

**macOS:** because the app is not notarized, Gatekeeper quarantines the
download and shows *"flextunnel" is damaged and can't be opened*.

The cleanest fix is to avoid the quarantine flag in the first place: browsers
set `com.apple.quarantine` on downloads, but command-line tools like `curl` and
`wget` do not. Download the disk image from the terminal instead:

```sh
# Replace vX.Y.Z with the release tag from the Releases page.
curl -fL -o flextunnel-desktop.dmg \
  https://github.com/andrewtheguy/flextunnel/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/flextunnel-desktop-macos-arm64.dmg
```

Then in Finder: double-click the `.dmg` to open it, drag `flextunnel.app` onto
the **Applications** shortcut in the window (choose **Replace** if an older copy
is already there), then eject the mounted image.

> **macOS zsh note:** the shell snippets in this README include `#` comment
> lines. zsh (the macOS default shell) treats `#` as a comment on an
> interactive prompt only after `setopt interactivecomments`; without it,
> pasting a `#` line reports `command not found`. Run `setopt interactivecomments`
> once per session, or just omit the comment lines when pasting.

If you already downloaded the `.dmg` via a browser, the quarantine flag
propagates to the app you copy out of it; remove it after installing (into
`/Applications`) instead:

```sh
xattr -cr /Applications/flextunnel.app
```

Alternatively, right-click the app and choose **Open** the first time.

**Windows:** SmartScreen's *"Windows protected your PC"* warning is triggered by
the Mark of the Web (the `Zone.Identifier` stream), which — like macOS
quarantine — is set by browsers but not by command-line tools. Avoid it the same
way: download with `curl.exe` (bundled in Windows 10+) or PowerShell instead of a
browser. Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the release tag from the Releases page:

```powershell
curl.exe -fL -o flextunnel-desktop.msi `
  https://github.com/andrewtheguy/flextunnel/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/flextunnel-desktop-windows-amd64.msi
# or: Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile flextunnel-desktop.msi `
#   https://github.com/andrewtheguy/flextunnel/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/flextunnel-desktop-windows-amd64.msi
```

If you already downloaded via a browser, strip the mark instead:
`Unblock-File .\flextunnel-desktop-windows-amd64.msi` (or right-click →
Properties → **Unblock**). Otherwise click **More info → Run anyway**.

## Build from source

```sh
cargo build --release
# binaries: target/release/flextunnel, target/release/flextunnel-agent
```

Requires a recent Rust toolchain (edition 2024). A bare `cargo build --release`
uses the workspace's default members and builds the CLI and the agent, but not
the iOS static library. To cross-build static Linux binaries for amd64 + arm64
via Docker, use `./build-linux.sh`.

## Quick start

### 1. Generate credentials (once)

```sh
flextunnel generate-server-key -o server.key   # prints the server's EndpointId
flextunnel show-server-id --secret-file server.key   # re-print the EndpointId
flextunnel generate-auth-token                  # a client auth token
```

Keep `server.key` private (written `0600` on Unix). Share the **EndpointId**
and the **auth token** with clients.

### 2. Configure and run the server (no root needed)

The routed set is required and is configured in `server.toml`. This example is a
full tunnel; narrow it later with specific domains/CIDRs if you want split
tunneling.

```toml
secret_file = "./server.key"

# Accepted client auth tokens (prefix `ftc`, from `flextunnel generate-auth-token`).
# Within this config file, inline tokens and a token file combine.
auth_tokens = ["ftcXXXXXXX"]
# auth_tokens_file = "/etc/flextunnel/auth_tokens.txt"

routed_domains = ["*"]
routed_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]

[host_aliases]
"server.internal" = "127.0.0.1"
```

```sh
flextunnel server -c server.toml
```

It prints `flextunnel server Node ID: <ENDPOINT_ID>` — give that to clients.

### 3. Run the client (no root needed)

```sh
flextunnel client \
    --server-node-id <ENDPOINT_ID> \
    --auth-token     <AUTH_TOKEN> \
    --socks-listen   127.0.0.1:1080
```

### 4. Use it

Point any SOCKS5 client at `127.0.0.1:1080`. Use `socks5h://` so routed
hostnames reach flextunnel as names and are resolved on the server side:

```sh
# With the full-tunnel routed set above, DNS + connect happen server-side.
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 https://example.com

# a server-side host alias, for example server.internal -> 127.0.0.1
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 http://server.internal:8000/

# SSH through the proxy
ssh -o ProxyCommand='nc -X 5 -x 127.0.0.1:1080 %h %p' user@internal-host
```

#### Server status page

From a connected client, `flextunnel.internal` is reserved by flextunnel and is
always tunneled to the server, regardless of the routed set. The browser view is
HTML; `/status.txt` is plain text and `/status.json` is structured JSON for
scripts:

```sh
# plain-text status through the default SOCKS5 listener
curl -sS -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 http://flextunnel.internal/status.txt

# JSON status through the default SOCKS5 listener
curl -sS -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 http://flextunnel.internal/status.json

# same endpoint through the optional HTTP proxy listener
curl -sS -x http://127.0.0.1:8081 http://flextunnel.internal/status.txt
curl -sS -x http://127.0.0.1:8081 http://flextunnel.internal/status.json
```

The JSON response includes `version`, `server_node_id`, `routed_domains`,
`routed_cidrs`, `host_aliases`, `agent_routes`, and duplicate-id blocklist
counts under `duplicate_id_blocklist`.

For more ways to use the proxy — `curl`/`git`/browser recipes, `ssh` through the
tunnel, and putting a plain local TCP port in front of it for apps that can't
speak SOCKS5 (databases, RDP, most GUIs) — see
[`docs/proxy-usage.md`](docs/proxy-usage.md).

#### HTTP proxy front-end (optional)

Add `--http-listen <ADDR>` to also run an HTTP proxy alongside SOCKS5 — useful
for the many tools that only speak an HTTP proxy or whose SOCKS5 support
resolves DNS client-side (`wget`, Docker pulls, npm/yarn, JVM/JDBC, .NET). It
handles HTTPS (and any TCP) via `CONNECT` tunneling and plain-HTTP via
absolute-URI forwarding; either way the hostname goes to the proxy, so DNS
still happens on the server.

```sh
flextunnel client \
    --server-node-id <ENDPOINT_ID> \
    --auth-token     <AUTH_TOKEN> \
    --http-listen    127.0.0.1:8081     # SOCKS5 on :1080 stays on

# HTTPS tunnels via CONNECT; plain HTTP is forwarded
https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8081 curl https://example.com
http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8081  curl http://example.com
```

See [`docs/http-proxy-roadmap.md`](docs/http-proxy-roadmap.md) for the gap
analysis and what it doesn't cover (raw-TCP apps still need SOCKS5 or `socat`).

## Configuration files

Instead of passing everything on the command line, `server` and
`client` can read a TOML file:

```sh
flextunnel server -c server.toml
flextunnel client --default-config   # ~/.config/flextunnel/client.toml
```

Precedence is **CLI flag > config file > built-in default**, so you can keep a
file and override settings on the command line. Credential groups are replaced
as a unit: for example, if the CLI supplies either `--auth-token` or
`--auth-token-file`, the config file's client token fields are ignored. Unknown
or misspelled keys are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`) rather than silently
ignored. Paths support `~` expansion.

See [`server.toml.example`](server.toml.example) and
[`client.toml.example`](client.toml.example) for the full set of keys. A minimal
client file:

```toml
server_node_id = "<server endpoint id>"
socks_listen   = "127.0.0.1:1080"
auth_token     = "ftc…"        # or: auth_token_file = "~/.config/flextunnel/token.txt"
```

Secrets may be inline (as above) or kept in separate files via the `*_file`
keys. CLI flags still work and override any of these.

## Host aliases (server-side)

The server config can map hostnames to addresses on its own network, so a client
can reach the server's loopback or internal hosts by a real name. Add a
`[host_aliases]` table to `server.toml` (config-file only — there is no CLI flag):

```toml
[host_aliases]
"server.internal" = "127.0.0.1"      # the server's own loopback
"node2.internal"  = "192.168.1.50"   # another host on the server's network
```

When a requested hostname matches a key (case-insensitive), the server rewrites
it to the value — an IP or another hostname — keeping the requested port, then
resolves and connects like any other target. Only domain targets are aliased;
literal IPs pass through unchanged.

This is also the clean way around Firefox refusing to proxy literal
`localhost` / `127.0.0.1`: alias `server.internal` → `127.0.0.1` on the server and
browse to `http://server.internal:8000/`. Use `socks5h://` (or set Firefox's
`network.proxy.socks_remote_dns = true`) so the name is resolved by the server,
not locally.

## Reverse-routing agent

Where a `[host_aliases]` entry resolves to a host on the **server's** network, an
`[agent_routes]` entry resolves to a connected **agent** — a `flextunnel-agent`
process on some other machine. The agent dials the server (like a client) but runs
no SOCKS5 listener; instead it accepts the streams the server opens back to it and
connects each to `127.0.0.1` on its own machine. This lets a client reach a service
behind NAT that the server cannot dial directly: the agent makes the outbound
connection, and the server pushes streams back over it. Reverse routing is
**loopback-only** in v1.

The agent is a **separate binary** (`flextunnel-agent`, for Linux, macOS, and
Windows) and identifies itself by a stable **network id** (`ftm1…`) — a one-way
hash, with a version prefix, of its OS-native machine id (`/etc/machine-id` on
Linux, `IOPlatformUUID` on macOS, `MachineGuid` on Windows; no elevation needed).
The raw machine id never leaves the host; only the network id is sent. Its iroh
node id is ephemeral, so there is no key file to manage. Only one agent runs per
machine (enforced by a machine-wide loopback-UDP singleton lock, so no elevated
privileges are needed). It authenticates with its **own** token pool
(prefix `fta`, separate from client `ftc` tokens).

```sh
# On the agent host: get this agent's network id to reserve on the server.
flextunnel-agent machine-id              # -> shows the raw id + derived ftm1… id
# On the server host: generate an agent token (add to agent_auth_tokens).
flextunnel-agent generate-token          # -> fta…
```

```toml
# server.toml
agent_auth_tokens = ["fta…"]
routed_domains    = ["web.internal", "*.example.com"]   # the alias must be on the routed set

[agent_routes]
"web.internal" = { machine_id = "ftm1…" }   # from `flextunnel-agent machine-id`
```

```sh
# On the agent host (Linux/macOS/Windows):
flextunnel-agent run --server-node-id <server id> --auth-token fta…
# then from a client: curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 http://web.internal:8000/
```

A second agent presenting the **same** network id (e.g. a cloned VM image whose
machine id was never regenerated) is rejected and the network id is recorded
in the blocklist — fix the duplicate id and clear the entry to recover. See
[`agent.toml.example`](agent.toml.example).

To run the agent as a Windows service (starting at boot, before any
interactive logon — e.g. to keep remote desktop access to the machine
available), see [`docs/windows-service.md`](docs/windows-service.md).

## Routed-set split-tunneling

The routed set (the **tunnel set**) is a VPN-style split-tunnel "included routes"
list that decides which destinations traverse the tunnel. Targets not on it are
**not** rejected — the client falls back to a direct connection for them. It is
useful when a client must send *all* its traffic to the local SOCKS5 proxy (e.g.
an iOS WebView, whose proxy config is global) but only some hosts should actually
be tunneled. It is **required** and configured on the **server only** (config-file
only — there is no CLI flag); the client configures nothing:

```toml
# server.toml
routed_domains = ["*.example.com", "httpbin.org"]
routed_cidrs   = ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.1.5"]
```

The tunnel set is required: a server started with an empty set **refuses to
start**, and a client that receives an empty set from a (misconfigured or old)
server **aborts the handshake** rather than silently direct-connecting
everything. To route **all** traffic through the tunnel (full tunnel), use the
catch-alls:

```toml
routed_domains = ["*"]
routed_cidrs   = ["0.0.0.0/0", "::/0"]
```

The server is the single source of truth. It **pushes** the list to every client
in the handshake response, so there is no client list to keep in sync:

- **Client** — on connect it learns the server's list. It tunnels only matching
  targets and connects everything else **directly** from its own network
  (split-tunneling). The direct path is independent of the tunnel, so off-list
  targets keep connecting even while the tunnel is down; an on-list target during
  a drop/backoff gets a SOCKS5 network-unreachable reply (`0x03`) rather than
  hanging.
- **Server** — it also enforces the same list independently as a **whitelist**,
  **rejecting** any tunnel request for a target not on it (SOCKS5 reply `0x02`).
  This is a defense-in-depth boundary against a misconfigured or untrusted
  client. (Note the asymmetry: the client falls back to a direct connection for
  off-list targets, whereas the server rejects them outright.)

Matching: domain entries are exact (`example.com`), wildcard (`*.example.com`,
which matches subdomains only — not the bare apex), or `*` (matches every
hostname), case-insensitive; CIDR entries match IP targets, accept a bare IP as a
single host, and a default route (`0.0.0.0/0` / `::/0`) matches every IP.
Hostnames are matched only against `routed_domains` and IPs only against
`routed_cidrs`. A numeric IP literal is always gated by `routed_cidrs` even
when a client sends it in hostname form (SOCKS5 `ATYP_DOMAIN`), so `*` never lets
a raw IP through — it can only route real hostnames.

Only the **combined** set must be non-empty — setting just one list is fine. The
two never cross: an omitted/empty list means that whole category is off-list and
always direct-connected. So `routed_domains` alone (no `routed_cidrs`)
tunnels those hostnames but direct-connects every bare-IP target, and
`routed_cidrs` alone tunnels those IPs but direct-connects every hostname.

### Roadmap

- **Client blocking mode.** Today the client **always direct-connects** every
  off-list target (split-tunneling), and this is
  the same for the desktop and iOS clients (they share the same core). A future
  client option — likely `routed_mode = "block" | "direct"` (default
  `"direct"`) — will let a client instead **refuse** an off-list connection,
  returning a SOCKS5 error to the local app rather than falling back to a direct
  connection. This is aimed mainly at the desktop client, where blocking off-list
  traffic can be preferable to letting it leak out directly; the iOS client keeps
  defaulting to direct-connect. (The server's `0x02` rejection above is a
  separate, server-side control and is unaffected.)
- **Richer agent routes.** Reverse routing is loopback-only in v1: every
  `[agent_routes]` entry dials `127.0.0.1` on the agent. A follow-up will let one
  agent (one machine id) expose several hostnames, each mapped to a chosen host/IP
  on the agent's own network (an `agent_ip` field, default `127.0.0.1`) — likely
  either per-domain entries or a grouped `[[agent]]` array-of-tables.

## Reconnect behavior

Auto-reconnect is **enabled by default** (`auto_reconnect = true`); pass
`--no-auto-reconnect` (or set `auto_reconnect = false`) to disable it, and
`--auto-reconnect` to force it on over a config that disabled it.

- The **first** connection must succeed. If it fails — bad node id, wrong
  relay, server down, or a rejected token — the client **exits immediately**
  rather than retrying blindly.
- Once connected at least once, a transient drop triggers reconnection with
  **exponential backoff + jitter** (1s → 60s), indefinitely, unless
  `--max-reconnect-attempts` caps it or auto-reconnect is disabled.
- A permanent error (auth/config) never retries.
- The local SOCKS5 listener stays bound across reconnects, so local apps queue
  briefly instead of seeing connection-refused during the gap.

## Logging

Logging uses `env_logger`. The default is `info` with iroh/tracing quieted to
`warn`. Override with `RUST_LOG`, e.g. `RUST_LOG=flextunnel=debug`.

## Documentation

- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — how it works: connection
  lifecycle (fixed ALPN, auth handshake, per-stream protocol), module map,
  concurrency model, reconnect policy, security boundaries, and reference
  constants.
- [`docs/http-proxy-roadmap.md`](docs/http-proxy-roadmap.md) — the HTTP proxy
  front-end (CONNECT tunneling + absolute-URI forwarding): motivation, design,
  and remaining hardening work.
- [`docs/proxy-usage.md`](docs/proxy-usage.md) — using the SOCKS5 and HTTP
  proxies: which listener a tool needs, native SOCKS5 clients (`curl`, `git`,
  browsers), HTTP-proxy-only tools (`wget`, Docker, JVM/JDBC, .NET), `ssh`
  through the tunnel, and `socat`/`ssh -L`/`-D` forwards for apps that speak
  neither.

## How it relates to ezvpn

flextunnel is modeled on the sibling project **ezvpn** (an IP-over-QUIC VPN),
reusing its iroh transport, auth-token scheme, and secret-key
identity. The difference: ezvpn creates a TUN device and ships IP packets over
unreliable QUIC datagrams (and needs root); flextunnel exposes a SOCKS5 listener
and tunnels TCP over reliable QUIC streams (and needs no root).
